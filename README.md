# 3D Modelling Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio's repository! This project is part of my second-year 3D Design module at NTU. We were asked to create assets using 3DS Max that fit the theme: **The Natural World** and use them to build a scene in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). This was one of my favourite projects of the year ... spent so many hours figuring out blue prints just so I could pop-in a few inside jokes for the fun of it. 

You can find all the models in the [FBX](https://github.com/Hannah-Ashna/3D-Design-Portfolio/tree/main/FBX%20Files) folder and the scene itself in the [Portfolio World](https://github.com/Hannah-Ashna/3D-Design-Portfolio/tree/main/PortfolioWorld) Folder.

If you fancy a look through my portfolio piece, you can find that [here](https://github.com/Hannah-Ashna/3D-Design-Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio.pdf). The references for all the textures I used for the project is available on the final page of that document.
